Why I Created This Plan
-------------

I created this plan to help guide me in my persuit of becoming a Software Engineer. My goal is to dive deeper into computer science topics and expand my knowledge to be able on more complex projects. 

I want to increase my chance of interviewing at top companies (Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft etc.). This guide will help me to remain motivated and focus. It will also stand as a form of accountability, since I’ll be documenting my progress here.

My goal is to go from a Front-End Web Developer to a Software Engineer.  I’m publishing this here so that anyone who finds it can gain a little motivation and inspiration, and to share my progress.
